<h1>Reinventing the Way You Think of Public Speaking</h1>
<p>
We've all practiced public speaking one way or another: you've recited your speech to
the mirror thousands of times, or you've forced your mom to listen it until you're both sick of
it. TEMPNAME is just like that, except it takes you and your mom out of the equation. We let you
record your speech and broadcast it to a curated group of users who'll give you objective feedback
and help you fix what you need to. That way you'll have a huge, online audience listening only to you.

</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>
After you sign up, you can upload your presentation, whether it be a slideshow or a PDF. You'll then
record your speech, with the uploaded document as your notes. After being processed, you'll get
valuable metrics like words per minute, average speaking volume, number of filler words used, and more.
If you choose to upload your speech, you can have users comment on what you need to fix, and what you did 
right.

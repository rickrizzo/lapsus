# Lapsus Linguae
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickrizzo/lapsus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rickrizzo/lapsus)

A presentation application that does more than give you tips. Lapsus captures what you say and turns it into text on your screen. This allows you to see what you actually said and see where you can improve your speech or presentation. Lapsus allows you to get feedback quickly and easily within the browser!

##Installing
To run the latest version on your local machine, clone the repository, and call npm install, and then npm start, and Lapsus will be running on port 3000

##Branches and Their Purpose
###_master_
The most up-to-date working version of Lapsus application, currently under active development and refactoring. Now deployed on Node & Express.

###_pullao_
Front end work fresh off the presses from Oscar

###_lapsus-2014_
This is the original version of Lapsus. In this version you can record yourself speaking (up to 10 minutes) and then watch audio and video seperatly or together to get feedback from peers both online and in person.  We're undergoing some big renovations this semester to get a v1 out!

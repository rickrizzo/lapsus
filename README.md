# Lapsus Linguae

A presentation application that does more than give you tips. Lapsus captures your movements and speech so you can get feedback quickly and easily within the browser!

You can record yourself speaking (up to 10 minutes) and then watch audio and video seperatly or together to get feedback from peers both online and in person.  We're undergoing some big renovations this semester to get a V1 out!
